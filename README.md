# bashdotfiles
All the bash files I need. 

## Steps 
1. just checkout to a directory of you choice. Let's say ~ (or the home dorectory) 
2. in your .bashrc file, add a line that says `source ~/bashdotfiles/.bashrc` 
3. and restart your bash prompt and voila, you are done.  

## What's in here 
1. just take a look at the aliases that are available in `~/bashdotfiles/.bash_aliases` and the functions and exports are available in similar files.
